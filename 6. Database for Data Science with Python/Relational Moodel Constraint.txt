- In any well-designed database, maintaining data integrity is essential to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the stored information. This lab focuses on three key relational model constraints:



- Entity Integrity: 
	+ This constraint ensures that every table in a relational database has a primary key. 
	+ A primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
	+ A primary key column(s):
		. must not contain NULL values
		. must be unique across all rows
	+ This constraint guarantees that each record (or entity) in a table is distinct and identifiable, preventing duplication and missing identifiers.


- Referential Integrity:
	+ This constraint ensures that a foreign key in one table always refers to a valid primary key in another table. 
	+ This maintains consistent and meaningful relationships between tables.
	+ It enforces the logical link between related data in different tables, preventing the existence of invalid or "orphaned" references.




- Domain Integrity: 
	+ This constraint ensures that all values stored in a column fall within a defined domain. 
	+ This includes rules about:
		. Data type
		. Format
		. Allowed values
		. Nullability
	+ It helps ensure that data in a column is valid, logical, and consistent with its intended use.
