- Artificial Neural Networks: Collections of small computing units (neurons) that process data and learn to make decisions over time.

- Bayesian Analysis: A statistical technique that uses Bayes' theorem to update probabilities based on new evidence.

- Business Insights: Accurate insights and reports generated by generative AI can be updated as data evolves, enhancing decision-making and uncovering hidden patterns.

- Cluster Analysis: The process of grouping similar data points together based on certain features or attributes.

- Coding Automation: Using generative AI to automatically generate and test software code for constructing analytical models, freeing data scientists to focus on higher-level tasks.

- Data Mining: The process of automatically searching and analyzing data to discover patterns and insights that were previously unknown.

- Decision Trees: A type of machine learning algorithm used for decision-making by creating a tree-like structure of decisions.

- Deep Learning Models: Includes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that create new data instances by learning patterns from large datasets.

- Generative AI: A subset of AI that focuses on creating new data, such as images, music, text, or code, rather than just analyzing existing data.

- Market Basket Analysis: Analyzing which goods tend to be bought together, often used for marketing insights.

- Naive Bayes: A simple probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): A field of AI that enables machines to understand, generate, and interact with human language, revolutionizing content creation and chatbots.

- Precision vs. Recall: Metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

- Predictive Analytics: Using machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes or events.
