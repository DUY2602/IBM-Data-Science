1. What is Data Science ?
=> Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, 
and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

2. Fundamentals of Data Science:
    - The Core Skills:
        + Math and Statistics: This is the theoretical foundation. You need a solid understanding of probability, 
        statistical analysis, and linear algebra to interpret data and build models correctly.

        + Computer Science and Programming: This is the practical application. Proficiency in languages like Python
         or R is essential for manipulating data, running analyses, and developing machine learning algorithms. 
         SQL is also crucial for working with databases.

        + Domain Expertise: You must understand the specific industry or business you're working in.
         This allows you to ask the right questions, interpret your findings in the correct context, and translate 
         data insights into meaningful business value.

        + Communication: The ability to present complex findings to non-technical stakeholders is vital. 
        This includes data visualization and telling a compelling story with your data.





    - The Data Science Process (or Lifecycle):

        + Problem Formulation: Clearly define the business problem you are trying to solve.

        + Data Collection and Preparation: Gather data from various sources and then clean, transform, and 
        prepare it for analysis. This is often the most time-consuming part of the job.

        + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistical summaries to explore the data and 
        uncover initial patterns and relationships.

        + Modeling: Apply machine learning algorithms or statistical models to make predictions or find insights.

        + Evaluation and Deployment: Test your model's performance and, if it's successful, integrate it 
        into a real-world application.

        + Communication: Present your findings and their implications to decision-makers in a clear and 
        understandable way.





    - Core Concepts and Techniques:

        + Data Wrangling: The process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.

        + Machine Learning: A subset of AI that involves training models on data to enable them to make predictions
         or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

        + Data Visualization: The use of charts, graphs, and maps to represent data, making complex information 
        more accessible and understandable.

        + Predictive Analytics: The use of statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast future outcomes.
