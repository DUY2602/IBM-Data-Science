- Big Data has five characteristics:  
    + velocity 
    + volume 
    + variety 
    + veracity
    + value.

- The five cloud computing characteristics are on-demand:
    + self-service 
    + broad network access 
    + resource pooling
    + rapid elasticity
    + measured service. 

- Data mining has a six-step process: 
    + goal setting
    + selecting data sources
    + preprocessing
    + transforming
    + mining
    + evaluation.â€¯

- The availability of so many disparate amounts of data created by people, tools, and machines requires 
new, innovative, and scalable technology to drive transformation.

- Deep learning utilizes neural networks to teach itself patterns in inputs and outputs. Machine learning is a 
subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to learn about data and make predictions without explicitly programming
 the analysis methods into the system.   

- Regression identifies the strength and amount of the correlation between one or more inputs and an output.

- Skills involved in processing Big Data include 
    + the application of statistics
    + machine learning models
    + some computer programming.
