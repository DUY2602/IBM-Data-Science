- Jupyter Notebooks are used in Data Science for recording experiments and projects.

- Jupyter Lab is compatible with many files and Data Science languages.

- There are different ways to install and use Jupyter Notebooks.

- Jupyter implements a two-process model with a kernel and a client.

- The notebook server is responsible for saving and loading the notebooks.

- The kernel executes the cells of code contained in the Notebook.
