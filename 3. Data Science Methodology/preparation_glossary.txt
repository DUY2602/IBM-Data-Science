- Automation: Using tools and techniques to streamline data collection and preparation processes.  

- Data Collection: The phase of gathering and assembling data from various sources. 

- Data Compilation: The process of organizing and structuring data to create a comprehensive data set.  

- Data Formatting: The process of standardizing the data to ensure uniformity and ease of analysis.  

- Data Manipulation: The process of transforming data into a usable format.  

- Data Preparation: The phase where data is cleaned, transformed, and formatted for further analysis, including feature engineering and text analysis.  

- Data Quality: Assessment of data integrity and completeness, addressing missing, invalid, or misleading values.  

- Data Set: A collection of data used for analysis and modeling.  

- Data Understanding: The stage in the data science methodology focused on exploring and analyzing the collected data to ensure that the data is representative of the problem to be solved.  

- Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics that data scientists use to describe and understand the distribution of variables, such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.  

- Feature: A characteristic or attribute within the data that helps in solving the problem.  

- Feature Engineering: The process of creating new features or variables based on domain knowledge to improve machine learning algorithms' performance.  

- Feature Extraction: Identifying and selecting relevant features or attributes from the data set.  

- Interactive Processes: Iterative and continuous refinement of the methodology based on insights and feedback from data analysis.  

- Missing Values: Values that are absent or unknown in the dataset, requiring careful handling during data preparation.  

- Model Calibration: Adjusting model parameters to improve accuracy and alignment with the initial design.  

- Pairwise Correlations: An analysis to determine the relationships and correlations between different variables.  

- Text Analysis: Steps to analyze and manipulate textual data, extracting meaningful information and patterns.  

- Text Analysis Groupings: Creating meaningful groupings and categories from textual data for analysis.  

- Visualization techniques: Methods and tools that data scientists use to create visual representations or graphics that enhance the accessibility and understanding of data patterns, relationships, and insights.
