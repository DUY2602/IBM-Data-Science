- Binary classification model: A model that classifies data into two categories, such as yes/no or stop/go outcomes.  

- Data compilation: The process of gathering and organizing data required for modeling.  

- Data modeling: The stage in the data science methodology where data scientists develop models, either descriptive or predictive, to answer specific questions.  

- Descriptive model: A type of model that examines relationships between variables and makes inferences based on observed patterns.  

- Diagnostic measure based tuning: The process of fine-tuning the model by adjusting parameters based on diagnostic measures and performance indicators. 

- Diagnostic measures: The evaluation of a model's performance to ensure that the model functions as intended.  

- Discrimination criterion: A measure used to evaluate the performance of the model in classifying different outcomes.  

- False-positive rate: The rate at which the model incorrectly identifies negative outcomes as positive.  

- Histogram: A graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset, where the data is divided into intervals or bins, and the height of each bar represents the frequency or count of data points falling within that interval.  

- Maximum separation: The point where the ROC curve provides the best discrimination between true-positive and false-positive rates, indicating the most effective model.  

- Model evaluation: The process of assessing the quality and relevance of the model before deployment.  

- Optimal model: The model that provides the maximum separation between the ROC curve and the baseline, indicating higher accuracy and effectiveness.  

- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC): Originally developed for military radar, this statistical curve is now used to assess the performance of binary classification models.  

- Relative misclassification cost: This measurement is a parameter in model building used to tune the trade-off between true-positive and false-positive rates.  

- ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve): A diagnostic tool used to determine the optimal classification model's performance.  

- Separation: The degree of discrimination achieved by the model in correctly classifying outcomes.  

- Statistical significance testing: Evaluation technique to verify that data is appropriately handled and interpreted within the model.  

- True-positive rate: The rate at which the model correctly identifies positive outcomes.
