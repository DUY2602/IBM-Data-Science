- Browser-based application: An application that users access through a web browser, typically on a tablet or other mobile device, to provide easy access to the model's insights.  

- Cyclical methodology: An iterative approach to the data science process, where each stage informs and refines the subsequent stages.  

- Data collection refinement: The process of obtaining additional data elements or information to improve the model's performance.  

- Data science model: The result of data analysis and modeling that provides answers to specific questions or problems.  

- Feedback: The process of obtaining input and comments from users and stakeholders to refine and improve the data science model.  

- Model refinement: The process of adjusting and improving the data science model based on user feedback and real-world performance.  

- Redeployment: The process of implementing a refined model and intervention actions after incorporating feedback and improvements.  

- Review process: The systematic assessment and evaluation of the data science model's performance and impact.  

- Solution deployment: The process of implementing and integrating the data science model into the business or organizational workflow.  

- Solution owner: The individual or team responsible for overseeing the deployment and management of the data science solution.  

- Stakeholders: Individuals or groups with a vested interest in the data science model's outcome and its practical application, such as solution owners, marketing, application developers, and IT administration.  

- Storytelling: The art of conveying your message or ideas through a narrative structure that engages, entertains, and resonates with the audience.  

- Test environment: A controlled setting where the data science model is evaluated and refined before full-scale implementation.
